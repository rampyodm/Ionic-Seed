# Ionic-Seed
Starting point for building an Ionic app.
This was created by starting with the Ionic "Todo" app. The controller, service, and module were split out into their own file and rearranged to be feature based. 

The original todo app can be found here: http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/building.html
